I am a Front-end Engineer born in Brazil. I have always been a fanatic for cool interfaces and designs. I have 10 years of experience in the software development area and 7 years in the front-end specific area. 
Today I'm always looking for new opportunities to see cool stuff and always interested in new experiences. 
Currently Angular is my favorite framework. Right now I work at Iteris as a Senior Frontend Engineer using JavaScript technologies like Angular, React and Nest to build modern interfaces and systems and study Computer Engineering at IFCE - Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Cear√°.
